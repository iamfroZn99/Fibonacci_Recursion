# Fibonacci Series value finder:

I have written a code in python which make calculations for the Fabunacci series numbers. It is not just an important cornerstone for mathematics but it also shows up in stuff tech, even natural patterns like sunrays and sunflowers.

I have made it on the principle of recursion. Any suggestions to make it better will be met with appreciation.

Simple logic. Deep patterns. Always evolving.
